   <h1>What does “force majeure” mean? I am afraid of losing the scholarship</h1> 
   <p>The force majeure clause means that mobility is interrupted for reasons beyond the student’s control, which forces to cancel the stay. In this case, the COVID-19 pandemic is considered force majeure. In cases where the destination institution cancels teaching, or circumstances occur that make it impossible to accomplish the mobility under normal conditions. It is especially considered a cause of force majeure in areas classified by SEPIE as risk zones. This cause applies if the stay has not exceeded the minimum amount that can be financed, or if it could not be started, but expenses have been incurred. In any case, from the Internationalization Office, we will take care to make the appropriate claims to the SEPIE. We will advise you then, to justify the expenses incurred “a posteriori”.

<h1></h1>Can I go to the campus to the library, to any class or activity organized by the university?
<p>NO. Until further instructions you must remain in your accommodation.
</p>
<h1></h1>I used to have a meal in the campus canteen. Is it allowed to have a meal there at least?
<p>NO. Meals will have to be taken at home or in your accommodations, being possible to buy them (take away) or ordering them for home delivery.
</p>
<h1></h1>I do not understand the sanity measures which I am told to respect clearly.
<p>Hygiene and often hand washing with soap and water, especially after coughing, sneezing and touching Cleenex.
    In case of not having soap and water, it is advised to use a hydro alcoholic solution.
    You should avoid, to the extent possible, touching your eyes, nose and mouth with your hands.
    You should cover your nose and mouth with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing, and to throw it away immediately after using it. In case of not having a handkerchief, you should cough and sneeze in the inner part of the elbow in order to not contaminate the hands.
    Is there any concrete recommendation which the university can provide during this alarm period?
    In any case, stay calm, the preventive measures have been implemented in order to contain the spread of the virus.
    Try to make your best for your academic performance using the ONLINE teaching tools.
    The academic course goes on officially, hence we suggest that you carry on with your mobilities.</p>
